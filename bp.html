                            1. Although I had 12 weeks for the internship, I was handed my project later on. The timeline was changing as well as the requirements. With my limited time I was able to research with 10 participants. <br><br>
                            2. Prior to my internship I had really only studied computer science terminologies. Through my internship I came across many terms and practices that I was not familiar to. I learned a lot through my short time at bp. <BR><BR>
                            3. The Helix team I was working with was based in London. Being based in Houston it meant that I was only able to communicate with them in a small window of time. Half way through my internship the team was also replaced by contractors who were new to the company and needed to be introduced to Helix. <br><br>

                            This experience has been instrumental in creating the foundation of my understanding of the design process and enhancing my design skills. My internship was a transformational experience because it helped bridge the gap between my background in
